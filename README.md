# QGIS Processing Framework: Automating Tasks with Python

A QGIS workshop for the GeoPython Conference 2018
\
\
This repository contains a few folders for use in the GeoPython Conference 2018 and whomever is interested in learning about
QGIS, its Processing Framework, as well as coding in Python.
\
\
This workshop talks about the **history and conception** of the Processing framework, **how it ties in and became part of QGIS**, as well 
as its **features, advantages and limitations**. The workshop then continues with an **introduction to a workflow, how to 
complete tasks manually**, and then moving into **hands-on exercises** that teaches participants progressively on 
**how to complete certain tasks manually, and how to complete the same tasks with tools that Processing offers: _Graphic Modeler_, _Script_,
_Batch Processing_, and more**. The workshop also covers **scripting (standalone from Processing)**, and as part of its bonus
materials, **method definitions and classes**.\
\
The workshop is created with **beginners in mind**, and welcomes both seasoned programmers and newcomers as it is progressive and broken
into digestable parts.
\
\
**Dataset** folder contains the relevant sample data you require to perform your geospatial analysis in the workflow\
**Scripts** folder contains the model scripts that you can reference as a guide and model to help you solve the task problems\
**Workflow** folder contains the original workflow that we want to automate, in case you want to try out the tasks without Python, or 
if you are very new to GIS/programming and cannot keep up\
**Presentation Slides** folder contains the presentation slides used during the workshop as well as the images shown on the slides
\
\
Help: In case you are stuck or lost, the folders also include a 'readme' file to guide you along.\
